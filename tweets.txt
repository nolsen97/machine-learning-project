this is your daily reminder that joe biden flew his son to china on air force 2 to help him secure a $1.5 billion deal with the ccp  and hunter biden still sits on the board of a chinese private equity firm‚Äîdespite promising to step down  why is the mainstream media silent?  rt!
one week ago today, democrats blocked a gop-led increase in funding for small businesses  today, that funding ran out.  democrats could have prevented this  nancy pelosi could have saved jobs and lives  instead she‚Äôs in san francisco not doing her job  she should be embarrassed.
democrats care more about appeasing china than the american people.
did you know:  ilhan omar's campaign is on track to pay her husband's consulting firm $1.16 million in 2020  last year, while she was having an affair with her now-husband she paid his firm $523k  how is this legal?  she's funneling money back into her own pockets  investigate!
in january, the who tweeted that china found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of covid-19  this was a chinese communist party lie.  now nancy pelosi says it is illegal for trump to halt their funding?  why are democrats siding with the wuhan health organization?  ü§î
facts:  california‚Äôs motor voter law resulted in at least 1,500 people, including non-citizens, being registered to vote  california‚Äôs secretary of state just admitted that multiple people voted multiple times last election  voter fraud is real  america needs voter id now!  rt!

cuomo‚Äôs been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state‚Äôs responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. i got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want independence! that won‚Äôt happen!

the @nytimes story is a fake, just like the ‚Äúpaper‚Äù itself. i was criticized for moving too fast when i issued the china ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @secazar told me nothing until later, and peter navarro memo was same as ban (see his statements). fake news!

the #paycheckprotectionprogram is a lifeline for small businesses on main street across america.   congress must urgently pass additional funding for this bipartisan, job-saving program.   there‚Äôs no time to waste. small businesses need our help ‚Äì and they need it now.

msnbc at coronavirus presser: you were not prepared in beginning of outbreak of virus.   trump: in the beginning when i halted flights from china it was your network that called me racist for doing so.   he called them out like a boss
senator rand paul has tested positive for covid-19. he is feeling fine and is in quarantine. he is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.
chinese communist regime still claims only a couple of hundred people died in tiananmen square massacre. why would anyone take covid19 figures it puts out at face value?
when joe biden eventually comes out of hiding, he needs to start answering questions about the deals that enriched his family while he served as vp--including via china. no bs prerecorded, edited interviews.  real questions broadcast live.  otherwise, he should drop out.
sen. mitch mcconnell is losing patience with democrats (and pelosi!) on the cares act, blaming them for "fiddling with the emotions of the american people... the markets... healthcare of the american people." he looks and sounds pissed. you don't see that from him most days. https://t.co/mjjbnzmoca

president trump and ny governor cuomo are demonstrating to the nation how to work together--and leave the politics aside.  both leaders are putting their citizens ahead of their political interests.   congress should take note.

@realdonaldtrump exactly. governors and local officials should let people out of their homes before they let criminals out of the jails.

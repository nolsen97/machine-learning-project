this is your daily reminder that joe biden flew his son to china on air force 2 to help him secure a $1.5 billion deal with the ccp  and hunter biden still sits on the board of a chinese private equity firm‚Äîdespite promising to step down  why is the mainstream media silent?  rt!
one week ago today, democrats blocked a gop-led increase in funding for small businesses  today, that funding ran out.  democrats could have prevented this  nancy pelosi could have saved jobs and lives  instead she‚Äôs in san francisco not doing her job  she should be embarrassed.
democrats care more about appeasing china than the american people.
did you know:  ilhan omar's campaign is on track to pay her husband's consulting firm $1.16 million in 2020  last year, while she was having an affair with her now-husband she paid his firm $523k  how is this legal?  she's funneling money back into her own pockets  investigate!
in january, the who tweeted that china found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of covid-19  this was a chinese communist party lie.  now nancy pelosi says it is illegal for trump to halt their funding?  why are democrats siding with the wuhan health organization?  ü§î
facts:  california‚Äôs motor voter law resulted in at least 1,500 people, including non-citizens, being registered to vote  california‚Äôs secretary of state just admitted that multiple people voted multiple times last election  voter fraud is real  america needs voter id now!  rt!

get rid of ballot harvesting, it is rampant with fraud. the usa must have voter i.d., the only way to get an honest count!
cuomo‚Äôs been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state‚Äôs responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. i got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want independence! that won‚Äôt happen!

....it is the decision of the president, and for many good reasons. with that being said, the administration and i are working closely with the governors, and this will continue. a decision by me, in conjunction with the governors and input from others, will be made shortly!
for the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the fake news media are saying that it is the governors decision to open up the states, not that of the president of the united states &amp; the federal government. let it be fully understood that this is incorrect....
....disaster, the energy industry will be strong again, far faster than currently anticipated. thank you to all of those who worked with me on getting this very big business back on track, in particular russia and saudi arabia.
having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that opec+ is looking to cut is 20 million barrels a day, not the 10 million that is generally being reported. if anything near this happens, and the world gets back to business from the covid 19.....
the @nytimes story is a fake, just like the ‚Äúpaper‚Äù itself. i was criticized for moving too fast when i issued the china ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @secazar told me nothing until later, and peter navarro memo was same as ban (see his statements). fake news!

the #paycheckprotectionprogram is a lifeline for small businesses on main street across america.   congress must urgently pass additional funding for this bipartisan, job-saving program.   there‚Äôs no time to waste. small businesses need our help ‚Äì and they need it now.
small business layoffs spiked 1,000% last month. 10% of the u.s. workforce is now jobless. this is no time for political games.  i hope democrats stop blocking more funding for the paycheck protection program very soon. american jobs depend on it. https://t.co/r1tgm8gc84

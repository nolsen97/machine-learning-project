mini mike is now negotiating both to get on the democrat primary debate stage and to have the right to stand on boxes or a lift during the debates this is sometimes done but really not fair,2020-02-02 00:25:10-05:00
many of the ads you are watching were paid for by mini mike bloomberg he is going nowhere just wasting his money but he is getting the dnc to rig the election against crazy bernie something they wouldnt do for corybooker and others they are doing it to bernie again 2016,2020-02-02 00:17:07-05:00
mini mike is part of the fake news they are all working together in fact bloomberg isnt covering himself too boring to do or other dems only trump that sounds fair its all the fake news media and thats why nobody believes in them any more,2020-02-02 00:10:56-05:00
the radical left do nothing democrats dont want justice when pushing the impeachment hoax they only want to destabilize the republican party so they can do better in the 2020 election amp that includes the house amp senate they are playing with the people by taking it this far,2020-02-02 00:04:56-05:00

thx ,2020-02-01 23:56:31-05:00
im very pleased the senate has rejected democrats request to call additional witnesses after the house chose not to  as i have stated this is not an impeachable offense and the witnesses sought by the house managers were available to them in the house,2020-02-01 23:55:42-05:00
the fact is the house chose not to call witnesses like john bolton because they wanted to impeach president trump before the election  it has nothing to do with finding the truth,2020-02-01 23:55:39-05:00
this has been a partisan impeachment from day 1  terrible on process and dangerous on substance  it rings hollow for adam schiff to talk about wanting a fair process finally the sooner this trial is over the better for the american people,2020-02-01 23:55:33-05:00
before democrats like adam schiff were trying to use john bolton to advance their political agenda they were railing against him for his lack of credibility,2020-02-01 23:54:15-05:00

weve known this has been a waste of time and a sham from the beginning and america is ready to move on i think theyve shown that by the lack of interest in the impeachment trial over the last couple of weeks sarahhuckabee ,2020-02-01 23:51:20-05:00
correct ,2020-02-01 23:48:56-05:00
a majority of the us senate has determined that the numerous witnesses and 28000plus pages of documents already in evidence are sufficient to judge the house managers accusations and end this impeachment trial my full statement ,2020-02-01 23:44:46-05:00
adam schiffs impeachment sham is over it was partisan unconstitutional unfair and flawed from the very start from schiffs coordination with the whistleblower to the fact that dems have publicly called for impeachment since the day after realdonaldtrump was elected,2020-02-01 23:43:45-05:00

after hearing the entire case presented i believe weve heard all we need in this impeachment trial the job of the senate is not to make up for the lack of investigation conducted by the house with what we have seen it is clear witness testimony is unnecessary,2020-02-01 23:38:20-05:00
when i took the oath at the beginning of the trial i vowed to deliver impartial justice according to the constitution amp the law i took this oath amp responsibility seriously and chose not to comment until i heard arguments from both the house managers and the presidents lawyers,2020-02-01 23:37:16-05:00
it became clear over the course of the house managers arguments that the house failed to undertake its responsibility to collect supporting evidence and the managers continually attempted to shift that evidentiary responsibility to the senate,2020-02-01 23:37:08-05:00
nevertheless having heard from both sides the arguments demonstrate that additional evidence or witnesses would not change the material underlying facts that describe the presidents actions,2020-02-01 23:37:03-05:00
